SNAP is an exciting card game that tests your reflexes and pattern recognition skills. This Java-based implementation of SNAP allows you to play the game in both one-player and two-player modes.

--How to Play-- 

The game starts by shuffling a deck of cards and dividing them evenly between the players.
Players take turns drawing cards from their respective decks.
When a player's drawn card matches the symbol of the previously drawn card, they must quickly type "snap" to win the round.
In the one-player mode, the player competes against a timer and must enter "snap" within a specified time limit.
In the two-player mode, the players compete against each other to be the first to enter "snap" when there is a match.
If a player successfully snaps and types "snap" correctly, they win the round and earn a point.
The game continues until one player runs out of cards or decides to quit.
At the end of the game, the player with the most points is declared the winner.
